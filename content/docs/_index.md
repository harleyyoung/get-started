## Introduction
As the proliferation of digital technologies continues to disrupt market segments and industries, adopting Amazon Web Services (AWS) can help you transform your organization to meet the changing business conditions and evolving customer needs. As the worldâ€™s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, AWS can help you lower costs, reduce business risks, improve operational efficiency, become more agile, innovate faster, create new revenue streams, and reinvent customer and employee experience. The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) leverages AWS experience and best practices to help you digitally transform and accelerate your business outcomes through innovative use of AWS. Use the AWS CAF to identify and prioritize transformation opportunities, evaluate and improve your cloud readiness, and iteratively evolve your transformation roadmap.
